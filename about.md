### Education

I am currently a master student enrolling at the University of Cambridge, the mathematical tripos, Part III. The focus of my courses are theoretical physics, but I am also very interested in and took a lot of mathematical courses. My PhD interests is in string theory, although because of the fierce competetion I might not be able to make it ...

Aside from study, I am interested in computer science, game design, to rhythm games, J-POP musics... if everything goes well you will find me touch on all of them in future posts


### Content of the posts

I am interested in lots of things, but I rarely have time to share my interests, and my opinions on them, to anyone else, so here is going to be a place for me to orgnise my thoughts on lots and lots of things I experienced, and why more (or less) people should care about them in the future.



### Language
Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your backgroud), the plan now is the posts is going to be mainly written in _Chinese_. It is not because I am bad at English: in fact the main reason is I use so little Chinese these days compares to English that I want this place as an excues for me to use it more. I am sorry for the English speaking users, but most of the Chinese written stuff is for myself and I doubt anyone is interested anyway. I will experment on how to translate things for other stuff, maybe a title in EN, maybe an synopsis, depending on the content.
