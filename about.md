I am currently a master student enrolling at the University of Cambridge, the mathematical tripos, Part III. The focus of my courses are theoretical physics, but I am also very interested in and took a lot of mathematical courses. Aside from study, I am interested in lots of stuff, from computer science, game design, to rhythm games, J-POP musics... if everything goes well you will find me touch on all of them in future posts

### Language
Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your backgroud), the plan now is the posts is going to be mainly written in _Chinese_. I might expand on the reasons on this in the future, and it is not because I am bad at English: in fact, I almost always think in English now, when I learn in class or when I just chill. I am sorry for the English speaking users, but most of the Chinese written stuff is for myself and I doubt anyone is interested anyway. If I post something I'd passionate to share in the future I will write them in English. Nevertheless, language traslation softwares are so good these days, especially translating to English, that Google probably does a better job of this than me even if I tried, so use that for now.


### Content of the posts

I am interested in lots of things, but I rarely have time to share my interests, and my opinions on them, to anyone else, so here is going to be a place for me to orgnise my thoughts on lots and lots of things I experienced, and why more (or less) people should care about them in the future.
